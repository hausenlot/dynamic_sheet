# Dynamic Excel Generator.
## Rails 7 Ruby 3.2.0 caxlsx gem and MySQL

Basically You can generate excel file on any table that is existing in your database (or that is listed on the schema)

### When I was at my old job I've been wanting to implement this because they're always ask many reports that they can do in the HRMIS webapp
### Well I resigned before implementing this but anyway this might be helpfull in the future.

# Current state
- No Design at all
- Can only generate 1 table at the time
- Can only remove columns, If you misclick just generate it again.

# Things to Improve/Add
- Design (Well I don't think so. It's just a showcase that the code works you can design it whatever you want.)
- Ability to Join tables
- Ability to add column
- Ability to design the spreadsheet


# How it works (I am really sorry for everything)
